    "    \n",
    "    Since the problem required finding a duplicate value with the minimum distance from the root in a binary tree, I first learned to implement basic tree construction and node traversal mechanisms. I selected BFS traversal method because its level-by-level approach suits the problem the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The main challenge I had was to implement recursive functions with dynamic queues and value tracking. I considered both exhaustiveness and efficiency in the value-checking logic. Through this process, I gained experience in managing queue structures and maintaining a seen-value list that updates during recursion, which required careful handling of initial states and iteration-based changes.\n",

    "Reflection of my review experience:\n",
    "    In reviewing my partner's assignment, I gained a deeper understanding of the concepts and implementation of lists, sets, and ranges in Python.Although the input is in list format, the task required comparing two groups of unique values. To facilitate this comparison, my partner converted the list into a set and constructed another related set, named full_set. This demonstrates the key differences between lists and sets\n",
    "    Additionally, I analyzed the time and space complexity of the solution step by step, which  improved my comprehension of each component in the solution.\n"
